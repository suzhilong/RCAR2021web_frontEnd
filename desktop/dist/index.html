      (IEEE RCAR 2021) will take place from July 15 to 19, 2021 in the beautiful city of 
      Xining, Qinghai, China. The objective of this conference is to provide a forum for 
      researchers in robotics and real-time computing to share the latest results and to 
      explore the opportunity of research collaboration. With wide applications of robots 
      in industry and services sectors, real-time computing plays one of the major roles 
      in various topics in robotics including real-time control, human-robot interactions, 
      sensor perception and fusion, robot intelligence, etc. The scope of IEEE RCAR 2021 
      covers research, development and applications in the dynamic and exciting areas of 
      real-time computing and robotics.
